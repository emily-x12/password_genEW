# Multiple prompts were created asking the user to choose a special character, lowercase, uppercase, and numeric character for their password.

# The user also is prompted with a question asking them to choose a length for their password which does not allow the choice to be less than 8 characters and more than 123.

# after all prompts are answered a password should have been generated but that does not happen as you can see.
